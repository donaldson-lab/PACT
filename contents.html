    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The Pyrosequence Annotation and Categorization Tool, or PACT, was created to automate
    the interpretation of results from large sequence similarity searches, particulary from BLAST.</p>
    <a name="Parsing">
    <h3>Parsing</h3>
    <p>To start an analysis with PACT, you need a BLAST file and the corresponding FASTA sequence file that produced the alignments. PACT will open with the Parser menu, but you can also click "File" and then "New Parser." In the section "Input  Files" enter a name for the parsing job and find the BLAST and FASTA files. These fields are mandatory</p> 
    <p>In addition to the input files, PACT allows you to specify how you would like the hit information of the BLAST file to be categorized according to a taxonomy or a classification of your defining. 
    <br/><li>Currently, PACT only bases taxonomic information on the NCBI Taxonomy, which is incomplete. </p>
